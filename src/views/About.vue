      <h1>CrispRE</h1>

      <p>
        With the developments of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies, the function of
        regulatory elements can be defined more precisely by this new paradigm
        in the functional screening of the genome with superior speed. Studying
        interactions between regulatory elements and their target genes can help
        to understand the genome structure and regulation mechanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, no such database collected the interactions between gene and
        their regulatory elements measured by CRISPR-based perturbations.
        Therefore, we reviewed literature that used CRISPR technology to
        identify regulatory elements and their target genes, and manually
        curated a database, including CRISPR-based interactions between
        cis-regulatory elements and target genes.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each interaction, CrispRE recorded detailed information about its
        biosamples, perturbation, phenotype measurements, and statistics. Each
        regulatory element in the CrispRE database contains detailed location,
        gRNA sequence, and CRISPR construct. Furthermore, for candidate
        regulatory elements, we also compared the expression of genes before and
        after CRISPR-based DNA perturbation.
